To start with first clone the repo and then run 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

also `Install the appropriate ChromeDriver`, cause selenium only works with ChromeDriver :) 

here is the link : `https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/`

make sure you donwload chromedriver and not chrome !

also add the location of chrome.exe from the zip you downloads to the code !

now run and enjoy destroying the monkeyType but make sure you use Fake account cause they ban fast!
